                        is a VoIP platform oriented towards providing text/voice communication to groups of video gamers
                        who connnect with each other online. In order to aid with moderation and to add some useful
                        functionality shortcuts to the group that my friends and I belong to, I used its 3rd party API
                        to build a bot. Features include custom "usergroups", canned responses, automated ACL, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bot was originally built using Python 2.6 (making use of the asyncio API), and is backed by
                        a Postgres database. It used to run in Heroku, but has since migrated to a small instance in
                        AWS.

                        I contributed a "dev container" setup to make developing it much easier to develop regardless of
                        what the computer being used is. I also helped debug and improve some issues regarding the
                        game's performance when running on an old Raspberry Pi.

                        Ship Spinning Inc. was a web based slot machine game built around
                        <a href="https://eveonline.com" target="_blank">Eve Online<VIcon icon="mdi-open-in-new" /></a>,
                        a massively-multiplayer online game. Ship Spinning connected with Eve via a complex XML API and
                        created a system in which Eve Online players could use their in-game "credits" currency to
                        activate a web-based animated slot machine, with which they could win in-game items prizes. The
                        system integrated with other APIs, in order to measure and ensure good payouts and to better
                        engage players. Over its lifetime, it provided entertainment for over 1000 players, and
                        distributed prizes worth thousands of dollars (if converted from in-game currency).

                        While it has no longer been maintained, its source code is still available online. Its user
                        interface was a custom jQuery-based site. The server was built in Python, using the web2py
                        framework and a SQLite database, and it was deployed on a virtual private server.

                    <p>
                        As a quick coding exercise to refresh myself on building webpages using Angular, I decided to
                        create a simple web UI allowing side-by-side comparison of two Twitter feeds â€” in this case, two
                        US presidents'. The UI allows individual manipulation of each feed, or a "synchronized" time,
                        alternating which feed scrolls back to keep the displayed tweets as contemporaneous as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user interface is coded using Angular and styled using Bootstrap. It is backed by a
                        lightweight Go-based webserver that uses a Postgres database for indexing tweets, and runs
                        regular crawls to keep the index up to date. It runs on Heroku and is deployed in a way that
                        allows for seamless horizontal scaling in case of going viral.
